## Secret Santas

A secret santa web application using Django. This is the final project for CS50's Web Programming with Python and Javascript. 


### Requirements

- Your web application must be sufficiently distinct from the other projects in this course (and, in addition, may not be based on the old CS50W Pizza project), and more complex than those.
- A project that appears to be a social network is a priori deemed by the staff to be indistinct from Project 4, and should not be submitted; it will be rejected.
- A project that appears to be an e-commerce site is strongly suspected to be indistinct from Project 2, and your README.md file should be very clear as to why itâ€™s not. Failing that, it should not be submitted; it will be rejected.
- Your web application must utilize Django (including at least one model) on the back-end and JavaScript on the front-end.
- Your web application must be mobile-responsive.


### Tools used

- Python Django
- Javascript
- Bootstrap
- Font Awesome (https://fontawesome.com/license)

### Distinctiveness and Complexity

This project is distinct and more complicated from all previous projects because:

- Customised notification system for each user (be it for members of  a group or the organiser)
- Smart secret santa algorithm to select the secret santa for each person (dynamically changes the secret santas when there's a change in the listing - reshuffling)
- Nesting of html files (svg animation) inside another html file
- Components (such as editing of pages) shows up only when needed (prevent cluttering of page)
- Appropriate usage of animation when needed, shadows (texture) to achieve a Neumorphic clean user interface 
- More models with complex relation between them
- Creation of HTML elements in javascript and the setting of their attributes 
- Mobile Responsive
